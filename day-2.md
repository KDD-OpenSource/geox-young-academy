Day 2
=====

**10. Oct. 9:00 - 17:00**

Goals
-----
[goals]: #goals

- Provide an overview of machine learning for classification (and regression)
- Explain the most common concepts and pitfalls
- Give some inspiration and show what can be done with machine learning

Preparation
-------

If possible, have the following python libraries ready:
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

If we don't run out of time, we will also do a quick exercise with pytorch:
```
conda install pytorch torchvision -c soumith
```
